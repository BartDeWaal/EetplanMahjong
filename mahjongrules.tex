\section{General Considerations}
This document is meant to describe the way we play mahjong at eetplan. The goal of the game is to make either money or ``money'', both expressed as points. The real goal of the game is to learn chinese.

Here we describe Mahjong as played by four players. If a different number is wanted, they will have to agree on the rules.

The game is played by playing rounds followed by rounds, until the players decide to stop.

To begin the game, give all players the same amount of points and choose a first host.

\section{Definitions}
\emph{The Wall} is the set of all tiles that would normally be drawn from, normally arranged in a pleasing manner.

The \emph{Kong Stack} is 12 tiles kept seperate from the rest of the Wall. It's used to top up a player's hand when they get a Kong.

A \emph{pair} is two duplicate tiles.

A \emph{set} is any one of:
\begin{enumerate*}
    \item A \emph{Pung}, three duplicate tiles,
    \item A \emph{Kong}, four duplicate tiles, or
    \item A \emph{Chow}, a run of three tiles in the same suit. A run means three tiles, one with the smallest value, one with the smallest value $+1$, one with the smallest value $+2$. Runs don't ``loop around''; 8, 9, 1 is not a run.
\end{enumerate*}

A player \emph{completes a hand} if it's her turn and she has four sets and a pair.

\section{Playing a round}
At the start of each round the tiles are shuffled and arranged into the Wall. Each player takes 13 tiles from the Wall, except the host who takes 14. 12 tiles are kept seperate from the Wall as the ``kong stack''.

The host starts his turn by taking a new tile.

A turn works as follows:
\begin{enumerate*}
    \item A player starts the turn by one of the following options. If multiple people can start the turn, priority goes to the highest item on the list. If multiple people can complete their hand, priority goes to the person who is closest in counterclockwise direction.
    \begin{enumerate*}
        \item The host starts the first turn.
        \item A player completes their hand using the tile that was just discarded.
        \item A player makes a pung using the tile that was just discarded. Any player that can make a pung using that tile can do this.

        First, she shouts ``Pung''. She takes the tiles, and puts it open in front of her hand. Then she takes two duplicate tiles from her hand and adds them, open, next to the tile she just took.
        \item A player makes a Kong using the tile that was just discarded. Any player that can make a kong using that tile and three hidden tiles in her hand can do this.

        First, she shouts ``Kong''. She takes the tiles, and puts it open in front of her hand. Then she takes three duplicate tiles that were hidden in her hand and adds them, open, next to the tile she just took.

        Now she takes a tile from the Kong Stack and adds it to her hand to replace the fourth tile she used for that set.
        \item The player to the right of the last player takes a new tile from the Wall.
    \end{enumerate*}
    \item If a player has a pung hidden in their hand she can declare it and seperate the four tiles, face down, from the rest of her hand. She takes a new tile from the pung stack.
    \item If a player has a hidden tile in their hand that matches a revealed kong she has, she can turn the kong into a pung using that tile. She takes a new tile from the pung stack.
    \item The player ends the turn:
        \begin{enumerate*}
            \item If the player has completed her hand, she says this. She does not reveal her hand until the end of the round.
            \item Otherwise, she discards a tile from her hand.
        \end{enumerate*}
\end{enumerate*}

A round ends when all players have completed their hand, or the Wall has no more tiles left. The players figure out the score and exchange points. The first player that completed their hand becomes host for the next turn.

\subsection{Scoring a round}
Points are exchanged according to the following rules:
\begin{itemize*}
    \item If player A completed her hand before player B, then player A never has to give points to player B.
    \item If a player gives or receives points and she is host, she receives or gives double points.
        % Bonus for winning from tile vs. from discard
        % Bonus for Kong
        % Points for "Didn't complete hand, but was closer"

        % Suggestions from a book:
        % points for completing hand from tile taken after Kong
        % points for completing hand from last available tile in wall
        % Bonus for hidden vs open Pung/Kong
